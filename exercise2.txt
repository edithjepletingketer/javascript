Declaration-
             Its when the variable is registered using a given name 
             within the corresponding scope. When you declare a variable 
             it is automatically initialized,which means memory is allocated
             for the variable by the java script engine.


Initialization-
             Variables are created when their containing Lexicall Environment
             is instantiated and are initialized to undefined when created.
             Initialization is the means of assigning an initial value to a variable. So  
             undefined is the intial value of a declared variable.
